## Detailed Fight Overview

### Quadruple Crossing

Same Bait Strat

Bait all proteans on intercardinals - DPS First, Supports Second 

Partner stacks on Cardinals in their safe spot - Light party stacks on East/West

* Supports rotate counter clock wise to where the DPS took their protean.
* DPS rotate clockwise to safe spot after baiting.

:::tip
This strat will be used on ALL Quadruple Crossings throughout the fight.
:::

### Double One-two Paw

Left safe first:
Stand at Intercardinal clone's Left, move to Cardinal clone's Right.

Right safe first:
Stand at Cardinal clone's Right, move to Intercardinal clone's Left.

:::tip
Light Party and Partner Stacks are resolved in the same positions as Quadruple Crossing.
:::

### Leaping Quadruple Crossing

Resolved the same way as first Quadruple Crossing. Only difference is where you treat north. NA Party Finder mostly does the mechanic facing True North.

:::warning
Boss Relative is not widely used. If boss relative, treat where the boss is facing as north.
:::

### Mouser 1

At the start, dodge into the initial safe tiles. Two of the four inner tiles will be safe and diagonal from each other. To deem which is safe, start on the side that is NOT getting hit first. Watch if the tile that is getting hit first gets hit again.

* If it gets hit only once, dodge into it after one hit.
* If it gets hit twice, dodge into it after one hit then back into the other tile once the other is hit.

The next part of the mechanic will knock-up (sending the player forward) or knock-down (same spot but unable to move or attack) all Supports or DPS. The paw-marker will dictate who is getting knocked-up or down.

* Left Arm Glowing + Reeling back = Knock-down
* Right Arm Glowing + Lunging forward = Knock-up

The person getting knocked-up or knocked-down will do the mechanic in their same tile no matter the version

* If  knocked-up, stand in one corner of the safe tile and look at the opposite corner.
* If knocked-down, you can look and stand anywhere in your safe tile.

Non-marked players must stay away from the adjacent tiles of the marked person or they will be knocked off the platform.

### Clones

The initial Leaping One-Two and Leaping Quadruple Crossing are resolved the same way they were earlier. Make note of:

* Clone positions and their tethered mechanic.
* Jump directions and safe side order. Use True North as the reference.

Watch which clone is tethered after the first two mechanics go off. The mechanic it was tethered with will start to do do that mechanic from that clone.

#### Quadruple Crossing / Nail Chipper Clone

* Resolved in the same fashion as same baits. Only difference is what role starts first.
* No-marker roles bait first, marked roles baits second. Stay away from marked players.

#### Leaping One-Two Clone

* As the room cleaves go off, light party stacks will appear on 2 players.
* Light party 1 north, light party 2 south of the boss. Use True North.

:::warning
Boss Relative is not widely used. If boss relative, treat where the boss is facing as north.
:::

### Mouser 2

Resolved the same way as Mouser 1 with an additional mechanic. The role who was not marked during Mouser 1 is marked for Mouser 2.

During each knock-up or down, 2 sets of a wild charge or protean bait will occur for a total of 4. The order is random.

Protean Spreads are boss relative left to right: Tank - Healer - DPS

### Raining Cats

MTTT (Everyone but tanks out after 1st stack)

:::tip
You may see: Hectorâ€™s Version: LP 1 south west and IN. LP 2 South East and OUT.

Additionally, this mechnic is generally skipped.It won't be seen unless there are a lot of deaths and low DPS.
:::

### Predaceous Pounce

Telegraphed AoEs and Dashes will appear on the arena. Simply dodge them.

:::tip
Mechanic is generally skipped.
:::

### Enrage

The boss casts another mouser which will destroy the entire platform, wiping the party.
