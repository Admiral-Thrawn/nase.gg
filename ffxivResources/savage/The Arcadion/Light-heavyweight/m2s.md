### Party Finder Terms

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="MarioKart" label="A1: MK N" default>
    AKA: Mario Kart

    Alarm Pheromones 1 will start in the north to begin baiting the bee lines. After the 4th line appears, move clockwise around the arena.

    :::tip
    You may see the strategy "Melee N, Ranged S." Bait the first four lines in the center of the arena; afterward, only melee jobs move north, while ranged jobs move south. Both groups then rotate clockwise to dodge baits.

## Detailed Fight Overview

***

### Repeat Mechanics

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Poison Drop" label="Poison Drop" default>
    Pairs are R+T and M+H.

    For line out -> in spreads, R spreads north toward the wall, and H spreads south toward the wall.

    For donut -> intercardinal out, supports spread clockwise or to the left facing the boss, while DPS spreads counterclockwise or to the right facing the boss.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Stage Combo" label="Stage Combo" default>
    No coordination of dodges. All lines and cleaves are aligned with the intercardinal compass arrows around the edge of the arena for reference.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

***

### Beat 1

The hearts emitted from the boss always rotate clockwise. All players should prioritize getting to 2 hearts as soon as possible without duplicating tower soaks. 
After towers, players with 2 or fewer hearts should gather south of the boss to share the stack marker.

***

### Alarm 1

Bee spawn locations and bait targets are randomized. Each player will eventually be targeted twice. 
Every strategy involves a significant amount of observation or improvisation ("use your eyes" or YOLO). 

Using knockback immunity will help survive one difficult dodge, at the cost of a short Damage Down debuff and a Slashing Vulnerability. 
A second hit will always result in lethal damage, except for tanks using invulnerability.

***

### Beat 2

Four players are assigned 0 hearts, and four players are assigned 1 heart.
0-heart players will bait several puddles as a stacked group, followed by two 0-heart players receiving a stack marker. 

Start in the south and rotate clockwise after each baited puddle. 
Overlapping the stacks does not cause significant additional damage or heart gain, so all four 0-heart players stack, and the 8 applied hearts will be evenly distributed.

* 1-heart players start in the north and rotate clockwise to match the 0-heart players.

* Two 1-heart players will receive a spread marker and should move far away from all other players, while the remaining 1-heart players soak the two towers. Supports soak the North or West tower, and DPS soak the South or East tower.

:::tip
The two towers will always spawn opposite each other.
:::

***

### Alarm 2

The first bees always spawn at cardinals, but successive spawns rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

Supports should prefer dropping puddles to the north at the wall, and DPS should drop to the south at the wall. However, there is enough room to drop at West or East, respectively, if a previous puddle was placed poorly.

***

### Beat 3

Debuff timers indicate defamation (defam) detonation. Timers are shared per role.

Towers spawn in pairs flanking opposite cardinals; only one tower will be adjacent to your intercardinal spread marker, so use it to determine which tower to soak for your role.

The dodge from the center to soak the tower is quick, and the boss will perform another stage combo between the first and second sets of defams and towers.

***

### Rotten Heart

Start in your clock spots. Plan for heavy mitigations and all self-heals, especially if the boss has multiple "simp" stacks, each of which adds 10% damage. With high DPS, most or all of this mechanic can be skipped.
