    AKA: Mario Kart

    Alarm Pheromones 1 will start in the north to begin baiting the bee lines. After the 4th line appears, move clockwise around the arena.

    :::tip
    You may see the strategy "Melee N, Ranged S." Bait the first four lines in the center of the arena; afterward, only melee jobs move north, while ranged jobs move south. Both groups then rotate clockwise to dodge baits.

## Detailed Fight Overview

***

### Repeat Mechanics

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Poison Drop" label="Poison Drop" default>
    Drop of Venom = Spread | Splash of Venom = Pairs
    - Pairs are R+T Noth and M+H South. Group 1 Left, Group 2 Right.
    - For Drop of Venom - Moving In, spreads or RTHM in two lines, North to South Group 1 Left Group 2 Right. R spreads north toward the wall, and H spreads south toward the wall.
    - For Drop of Venom - Moving Out, supports spread clockwise or to the left facing the boss, while DPS spreads counterclockwise or to the right facing the boss.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Stage Combo" label="Stage Combo" default>
    Two possible patterns.
    - Centerstage Combo: Start In on your safe intercardinal spot, move straight out, rotate to your cardinal spot.
    - Outerstage Combo: Start Out on your safe cardinal, rotate to your intercardinal while staying out, move in to your intercardinal spot.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

***

### Beat 1

The hearts emitted from the boss always rotate clockwise. All players should prioritize getting to 2 hearts as soon as possible without duplicating tower soaks. 
After towers, players with 2 or fewer hearts should gather south of the boss to share the stack marker.

***

### Alarm 1

Bee spawn locations and bait targets are randomized. Each player will eventually be targeted twice. 
Every strategy involves a significant amount of observation or improvisation ("use your eyes" or YOLO). 

Using knockback immunity will help survive one difficult dodge, at the cost of a short Damage Down debuff and a Slashing Vulnerability. 
A second hit will always result in lethal damage, except for tanks using invulnerability.

***

### Beat 2

Four players are assigned 0 hearts, and four players are assigned 1 heart.
0-heart players will bait several puddles as a stacked group, followed by two 0-heart players receiving a stack marker. 

Start in the south and rotate clockwise after each baited puddle. 
Overlapping the stacks does not cause significant additional damage or heart gain, so all four 0-heart players stack, and the 8 applied hearts will be evenly distributed.

* 1-heart players start in the north and rotate clockwise to match the 0-heart players.

* Two 1-heart players will receive a spread marker and should move far away from all other players, while the remaining 1-heart players soak the two towers. Supports soak the North or West tower, and DPS soak the South or East tower.

:::tip
The two towers will always spawn opposite each other.
:::

***

### Alarm 2

The first bees always spawn at cardinals, but successive spawns rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

Supports should prefer dropping puddles to the north at the wall, and DPS should drop to the south at the wall. However, there is enough room to drop at West or East, respectively, if a previous puddle was placed poorly.

***

### Beat 3

Debuff timers indicate defamation (defam) detonation. Timers are shared per role.

Towers spawn in pairs flanking opposite cardinals; only one tower will be adjacent to your intercardinal spread marker, so use it to determine which tower to soak for your role.

Before each defamation debuff expires, you will need to do either a Centerstage or Outerstage Combo.
As the combo finishes, the players' debuff that is not expiring need to run to the center of the arena to not get hit by the defamations.
The dodge from the center to soak the tower is quick.
After the first set of tower resolve, the boss will perform another stage combo. 
The debuff and tower soaking roles will be swapped.

***

### Rotten Heart

Before the mechanic starts, start in your clock spots. Everyone will be assigned either an Alpha (α) or Beta (β) debuff. 
Players with different debuffs who touch with the opposite debuff will cause a heavy hitting raidwide and apply a magic vuln.=

Each debuff has 4 sets of timers which are:
- 1m
- 44s
- 28s
- 12s

These timings can mostly be ignored as you will pop them at the duration they are ending.
Players will meet and touch in the center of the arena when their debuff reaches 6s remaining then return to their spot.
Doing this allows enough time for the magic vuln to fall off and your healers to heal.

If the debuffs are managed properly, the boss will be casting "Call Me Honey" as the vuln falls off.
This is a heavy hitting raidwide and will be cast after each pop.

Throughout this mechanic, plan for heavy mitigation and all self-heals, especially if the boss has multiple "simp" stacks, each of which adds ~3% damage.

:::tip
With high DPS, most or all of this mechanic can be skipped.
